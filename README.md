# Controls_Technical_Interview

Welcome to Dephy's Controls Technical Interview repo!

If you're reading this then you've made it to the point in the interview process where we want
to know more about you're practical programming and problem solving skills.

In order to submit a solution, clone this repo and create a branch as follows:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DephyInc/Controls_Technical_Interview.git
git checkout -b solution/FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME  # e.g. solution/luke_mooney
```
Once you are ready to submit your solution, create a pull request to _master_.
(Note: You will not have infinite time to submit your solution, but you should have your deadline
info in an email from us)

Depending on which part of the process you're in and what you're interviewing for (you should have 
this info in an email from us), you may be working out of the Algorithm_Challenge folder, 
Debugging_Challenge folder, or both. Look at the readme files in the applicable folder for more 
detailed instructions on what to do for each part of the process.

NOTE: 
If you're running on a Windows machine, you will need to install mingw (to get access to the gcc compiler).
	- Follow the minGW install instructions in the following link (ignore the cmake instructions): 
          https://wiki.dephy.com/wiki/flexsea/doku.php?id=installbuildtoolswindows&s[]=mingw 
If you're running on a Linux/Ubuntu 22.04 machine, you will need to install gcc by running the following 
in your command terminal:
	sudo apt-get install -y git gcc build-essential
	
If you're running on a MacOS, you will need to install gcc by running the following in your command terminal:
	brew install gcc

Good Luck!
