# **Elevator Problem**

The algorithm prioritizes minimizing travel distance by first serving the closest destination of any current passengers in the elevator. If the elevator is empty, it moves to the closest floor with waiting passengers. This greedy approach ensures continuous movement while keeping travel distances minimal.
